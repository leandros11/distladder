H0 measurment data analysis: Distance ladder vs One step methods

This the mathematica file that produces the statistical analysis and the figures for the paper 'Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?' which statistically compares H0 measurements based on distance ladder approaches with one step measurements that are independnet of the sound horizon scale.
Use Mathematica 13.0 .
The pdf file of the paper is also available for download here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11031.
